# City Bus Optimization

This project is aimed to increase City Bus' revenue by optimizing theie route and resource allocation.
The objective is to identify routes and it's performance at different times of the day to provide insights for CityBus to create a dynamic schedule based on the flux of passengers.
The base data model is made by normalizing the existing city bus database. The data is generated randomly for selected routes.
As consultants, we aim to create a managerial report summarizing the current state of operation based on the exploratory data analysis and provide insights that would help CityBus for appropriate resource allocation and route optimization.
